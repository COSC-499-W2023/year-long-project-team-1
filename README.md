## Project Description

    3. Video Streaming Using Cloud Technology

        Project goal: To create a web application using AWS services for professionals who will receive video submissions from users while protecting their privacy.

        Target users:
            - Senders: An average adult who has created a video of themself, has access to Internet and phone/computer, and may want to have their face blurred throughout the video for privacy reasons.
            - Receivers: Professionals (e.g., doctors, teachers, recruiters/interviewers) who need to review the video submissions for diagnosis or assessment reasons, and has access to Internet and computer.
        Things to think about when scoping your project: This list is non-exhaustive. It is only meant to get you thinking about the variety of ways you may choose to scope and design this project.
            - How can the app facilitate the recording of the video after the sender logs in?
            - How might senders review what has been recorded and decide if they want to re-record it before submitting it?
            - How will data security and user privacy be enforced and communicated to the senders?
            - Will the application be responsive to work on phones, tablets, and desktops?
            - Will the receiver be able to provide feedback to the sender, or request follow up video submissions?
            - How will professionals know when a diagnosis/assessment is required?
            - Can senders view their videos in the system and delete them?
            - Will the senders or receivers be able to decide how long the videos should be retained in the system?
