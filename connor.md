### 📋 Tasks Completed

![Tasks for term 2 week 9](./tasks/connor/t2week9.png)

### 🎯 Work Summary

Our region selection component was very outdated (did not support React 18). To avoid publishing outdated dependencies to the project, I reimplemented the library and added support for React 18 and TypeScript. I created this as a separate repository and published to NPM for portability and to make integration more straghtforward. Here is that repo: [https://github.com/connordoman/react-region-select-2](https://github.com/connordoman/react-region-select-2)
